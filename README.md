## About The Project
In a world where community engagement and social responsibility are more important than ever, 
Smakchet aims to connect volunteers with event hosts efficiently. The platform provides two types of 
users: normal users who can view and apply for events, and hosts who can post events and manage applications.
This project is designed to simplify the process of finding and managing volunteer opportunities,
making it easier for everyone to contribute to their communities.

Our platform leverages advanced technologies to create a seamless and intuitive experience
for both volunteers and hosts. With user-friendly interfaces, robust search functionalities, 
and secure communication tools, we make it easy for volunteers to find events that match their interests and for hosts to find the help they need.

Join us in creating a more engaged and connected community, one volunteer opportunity at a time.
